> **Detect fake reviews in real-time and build a more trustworthy digital marketplace!**

---

## üìö Project Overview

With the explosion of online platforms, fake reviews have become a serious threat to digital trust.  
The **Smart Review Detection System** is a cutting-edge solution that uses machine learning to **identify AI-generated and fake reviews** in real time, safeguarding consumers and promoting transparency.

‚ú® **Highlights**:
- **Real-time analysis** via Chrome Extension
- **5 advanced ML models** (LSTM, Random Forest, DistilBERT, LightGBM, SGD)
- **High accuracy** ‚Äî LSTM achieved an AUC of **0.994**
- **Secure backend** built with Flask & encrypted APIs
- **Color-coded results** with confidence scores for easy interpretation

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Data Collection**:  
   - 5,091 real reviews collected from Amazon.in API.
   - 5,000 AI-generated reviews using ChatGPT and Gemini.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Cleaning, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**:
   - Fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization across 5 ML models.

4. **Real-Time Detection**:
   - Reviews are extracted from Amazon pages using Chrome Extension.
   - Sent to the Flask server for classification.
   - Color-coded (üü¢ Real, üî¥ Suspicious) results displayed with confidence levels.

## üîí Security Measures

- **CORS Protection** for secure API access.
- **HTTPS Communication** for encrypted data transfer.
- **Secure Model Hosting** to protect intellectual property.

## üåç Limitations and Future Scope

| Current Limitations                      | Future Improvements                     |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Supports only Amazon.in                  | Extend to global platforms (Amazon.com, Flipkart, etc.) |
| English-language reviews only            | Add multilingual support (Hindi, Spanish, French, etc.) |
| Works when extension is actively used    | Background automation for passive protection |
| Hosted locally                           | Cloud migration for greater scalability |
